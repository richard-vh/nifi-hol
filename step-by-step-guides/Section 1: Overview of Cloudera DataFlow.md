![alt text](../img/datalifecycle.png)

Cloudera Open Data Lakehouse powered by Apache Iceberg offers several key benefits that can significantly enhance your data management strategy. First, it provides better **performance and scalability** through innovative metadata management and flexible partitioning. It’s **fully open**, meaning there’s no vendor lock-in—thanks to its open-source foundation, it **supports a diverse ecosystem and community**. The platform also supports **multi-function analytics**, allowing different compute engines to access and process Iceberg tables concurrently and consistently. For those focused on data quality and consistency, it includes advanced capabilities like **ACID-compliant transactions, time travel, rollback, in-place partition evolution, and Iceberg replication**. Finally, Cloudera’s solution stands out with its ability to enable **multi-hybrid cloud deployments**, offering the freedom and portability to deploy wherever you need.

This hands-on lab takes you through the data lifecycle showcasing the ability to work with the same Iceberg tables across multiple engine and analytics types.

## Before Starting the Labs

Your workload user name and password has been provided by the facilitator e.g. user001/hsgdguquuqyququ. Keep it handy as you'll need it for certain configurations.

We're going to create some Iveberg tables to use across the labs in this section.

1. Sign in to the Cloudera Control Plane web interface.
2. On the **Data Warehouse** tile, click on the ellipses &#10247;and select **Open Data Warehouse**.

3. Under the **Virtual Warehouses** tab, locate the **workshop-impala-vw**h virtual warehouse and click on the **Hue** application icon.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdw2.png)

4. In the Hue application that opens in your browser you should see that the Impala engine is selected. Impala is a parallel processing SQL query engine that enables users to execute low latency SQL queries directly against large dataset. Copy and paste the code below into the editor pane. The code uses variables, so enter your user id in the username variable that is displayed at the bottom of the editor pane (e.g. user001).

![alt text](../img/icebergcdw3.png)

```ruby
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS default.${username}_laptop_data;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS default.${username}_laptop_data_scored;

CREATE TABLE default.${username}_laptop_data (
  laptop_id STRING,
  latitude STRING,
  longitude STRING,
  temperature STRING,
  event_ts STRING
) STORED AS iceberg;

CREATE TABLE default.${username}_laptop_data_scored (
    laptop_id   INT,
    latitude    DOUBLE,
    longitude   DOUBLE,
    temperature DOUBLE,
    event_ts    STRING,
    anomaly     INT
)  STORED AS parquet;

SELECT * FROM default.${username}_laptop_data;
SELECT * FROM default.${username}_laptop_data_scored;
```

5. Use your cursor to select and highlight each SQL statement and execute each one by clicking the execute button :arrow_forward:.
   
   After executing all of the SQL statements you should have created 3 Tables: 2 Iceberg and 1 Parquet and ensured that they are not pre-populated.

If all is good then we're ready to get on with using Iceberg across the Data Lifecycle!!!

## Lab 1. Overview of the Cloudera Data Flow Service

### Overview of the Cloudera Data Flow Service

Cloudera Data Flow is a cloud-native universal data distribution service powered by Apache NiFi​​ that enables you to connect to any data source, process and deliver data to any destination. The cloud-native service enables self-serve deployments of Apache NiFi data flows from a central catalog into auto-scaling Kubernetes clusters, with centralized monitoring and alerting capabilities for the deployments. Let's familiarise ourselves with the Data Flow service.

1. Go back to the Cloudera Control Plane web interface.
2. Click the **Data Flow** tile.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf1.png)

3. The Data Flow landing page will open in your browser which is the Overview menu item from the menu on the left side on the screen. This page provides quick access to Data Flow features and other resources, guides and releaes information.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf2.png)

4. In the left hand menu select the next menu item **Deployments**. The Deployments page is the central place for managing and monitoring your Data Flow deployments running on Kubernetes and each executing a specific flow definition.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf3.png)

5. In the left hand menu select the next menu item **Catalog**. After building your flows, publish them to the central, version controlled catalog. From the catalog, you or your team members can create new deployments from the published flow definitions.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf4.png)   

6. In the left hand menu select the next menu item **ReadyFlow Gallery**. Cloudera Data Flow provides a growing library of ReadyFlows to get you started quickly. ReadyFlows are reference implementations of some of the most common data movement patterns in the industry.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf5.png)

6. In the left hand menu select the next menu item **Flow Design**. Flow Design allows you to create, test, and deploy data pipelines using the Flow Designer. Which is a visual, no-code interface built on Apache NiFi. This interface enables developers to design data flows that move, transform, and route data across various systems. Users can start test sessions to run and validate flows in real-time, making iterative adjustments quickly and easily. 

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf6.png)

7. In the left hand menu select the next menu item **Projects**. Projects is a workspace management feature that helps you organize and manage your data flow developments.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf7.png)

8. In the left hand menu select the next menu item **Resources**. Resources provide a high level overview of your various environments such as projects, deployments, drafts and other information in each.
 
![alt text](../img/icebergcdf8.png)

9. In the left hand menu select the next menu item **Functions**. Functions support running your data flows as serverless functions in AWS Lambda, Azure Functions and Google Cloud Functions. While auto-scaling deployments are great for low latency, high throughput data movement use cases, functions are ideal for event-driven or micro-batch related use cases where your flow does not have to be running 24/7.
 
![alt text](../img/icebergcdf9.png)

10. In the left hand menu select the next menu item **Environments**. Enviornments list all the automatically discovered enviornments in your Cloudera tenant and where Data Flow can be enabled or disbaled for each environment.

### Deploy a Custom Data Flow Template

Data Flow Templates make it easier to reuse and distribute data flows or specific parts of data flows. Besides reducing development time, reuse also supports the adoption of standards and patterns in data flow design. Data flow templates can help you to build a library of reusable elements that you can use as pre-built components in your new flows.

1. In the left hand menu select the next menu item **Catalog**. In the search field search for **hol-iceberg-populator**.
  
![alt text](../img/icebergcdf11.png)

2. Click the flow name **hol-iceberg-populator** and a context window will appear on the right side of the screen. In this context window click the **Actions** dropdown button and select **Create New Draft**.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf12.png)

3. In the **Create New Draft** popup screen, select **nemea-hol-v2-cdp-env** for the **Target Namespace**, **Workshop** for the **Target Project** and **userxxx-hol-iceberg-populator** for the **Draft Name** substituting your assigned user id. Then click the **Create** button. This will display the **Test Session** config page. Accept all the default values and click the **Start Test Session** button.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf13.png)

4. A Flow Design canvas will open for you. At the top right of the screen click **Flow Options**, and under that **Test Session** section click the **Start** button. This is going to spin up resource container for us to build our flow.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf14.png)

5. After the Test Session has initialised, at the top right of the screen click **Flow Options**, and under that click on **Parameters**. 

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf15.png)

6. On the **Parameters** screen, set the parameters values as indicated below substituting your assigned user id and password. Click the **Apply** button after making the changes and ignore any warnings messages.
 * CDP Workload User: **userxxx**
 * CDP Workload User Password: **userxxx_password**

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf16.png)

7. At the top right of the screen click **Flow Options** again, and under that click on **Services**.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf17.png)

9. On the Services page, click on each disabled services and click the Enable button for each one. After unebaling they should all have a green check icon next to them :white_check_mark:.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf18.png)

10. Go back to the Flow Designer canvas but clicking **Flow Designer** in the path breadcrumb amd let's start building our flow. You'll se an existing ExecuteContent processor on the canvas already. This is one we're already create for you to reuse that generates synthetic data. Typically this data would be coming from a source like Kafka, database system or IOT device. 

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf19.png)

11. On the tool menu on the left drag and drop a **Processor** tool onto your canvas. A popup will appear where you enter **MergeContent** into the search bar. Once it's found the **MergeContent** processor click the **Add** button to add it to your canvas.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf20.gif)

12. **Repeat** the same process to add a **PutIceberg** processor to your canvas.
    
13. Drag and drop the two new processors to align them neatly on your canvas in the order **ExecuteContent -> MergeContent -> PutIceberg**. Now move your cursor to the bottom right of each processor, clicking the arrow area and dargging and dropping the arrow to the processor you want to connect it to as shown below. For the **ExecuteContent -> MergeContent** connection select the condition of **Success** for the link and for the  **MergeContent -> PutIceberg** connection select the condition of **Merged** for the link.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf21.gif)

14. On the canvas select the **MergeContent** processor. In the conext window on the right set the following **Properties** and **Relationships** values for the processor:
     * Properties:
       * Minimum Number of Entries: 10
     * Relationships:
       * failure: Terminate
       * original: Terminate
    Click the **Apply** button at yhe bottom of the Processor context window. 

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf22.png)

15. On the canvas select the **PutIceberg** processor. In the conext window on the right set the following **Properties** and **Relationships** values for the processor:
     * Properties:
       * Record Reader: JsonTreeReader (select from dropdown)
       * Catalog Service: HiveCatalogService (select from dropdown)
       * Catalog Namespace: Select the ellipses &#10247;and select **Convert to Parameter**. In the **Add Parameter** popup, enter **default** into the **Value** field and click **Apply** button.
       * Table Name: Select the ellipses &#10247;and select **Convert to Parameter**. In the **Add Parameter** popup, enter **userxxx_laptop_data** into the **Value** field substituting your assigned user id and click **Apply** button.
       * Kerberos User Service: KerberosPasswordUserService (select from dropdown)
     * Relationships:
       * failure: Terminate
       * original: Terminate
  Click the **Apply** button at yhe bottom of the Processor context window. 

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf23.png)

16. On the canvas right click the **ExecuteScript** processor and select the **Start** option.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf24.png)

17. You should notice the **ExecuteScript** processor changes icon status to green meaning it's running and you should see flowfiles accumulating in the **Success** relationhip. Right click on the **Success** relationship block and select the **List Queue** option.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf25.png)

18. We can inspect the flowfiles that have been generated in the Queue by selecting any of the folowfile records and clicking on the **Open Data in Viewer** icon. Take a look at the data that is being generated across the different flowfiles.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf26.png)

19. On the canvas right click the **MergeContent** processor and select the **Start** option. Right click on the **mergecontent** relationship block and select the **List Queue** option. As in the step before look at the data in the flowfile and notice how it's merged the the original flowfiles into a larger flowflow based on the settings configured in the **MergeContent** processor.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf27.png)

20.  On the canvas right click the **PutIceberg** processor and select the **Run Once** option. This is a reallyt interesting feauture about Nifi where you can develop on the fly and control flowfiles between Processors individually while building and testing your flow without having to recomplie anything.

![alt text](../img/icebergcdf28.png)

21. If no warnings appear on the **PutIceberg** processor we can go to Hue SQL IDE and check we are getting data into our Iceberg table. See if you can remember how to to do this
> [!TIP] 
> **Data Warehouse** tile -> **Open Data Warehouse** -> **Virtual Warehouses** -> **workshop-impala-vw** -> **Hue**

```ruby
select * from default.${username}_laptop_data;
```
![alt text](../img/icebergcdf29.png)

22. Finally go back to your **Flow Designer** canvas and right click the **PutIceberg** processor and select the **Start** option. Our flow is running fully now and will continue to stream data into our Iceberg table. Typically we would productionise our flow by publishing it back to the **Catalog** and creating a **Deployment** it onto an autoscaling Kubernetes containers where it can be centrally monitored. But for the purposes of this hands-on lab we can leave it running in the Test Session.
