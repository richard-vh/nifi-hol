# Cloudera Nifi Hands On Lab

## About this Hands On Lab

This hands-on lab provides a comprehensive exploration of Apache Iceberg's capabilities within the Cloudera Data Platform. The agenda is structured into two main sections.

The first section focuses on core Iceberg functionalities using Spark within Cloudera Data Engineering on Data Hubs. Participants will learn how to create, populate, and manage Iceberg tables, including performing data manipulation (inserts, updates, deletes). The lab will delve into the technical details of Iceberg's metadata, different table types (Copy-on-Write, Merge-on-Read), and powerful features such as schema and partition evolution. Attendees will also get practical experience with advanced capabilities like time travel for querying historical data, rollbacks using snapshots, branching for isolated development, and strategies for migrating traditional Hive tables to the Iceberg format. Finally, essential table maintenance operations like compaction and snapshot expiration will be covered.

The second section demonstrates Iceberg's role as a unified table format across the entire data lifecycle and the Cloudera product stack. Participants will interact with the same Iceberg tables using various Cloudera services. They will use Hive in Cloudera Data Warehouse (CDW) to query data and explore features like time travel and maintenance. In CDE, they will build and schedule PySpark jobs to write data into Iceberg. Subsequently, they will use Impala in CDW to run high-performance queries, analyze execution plans to see the benefits of partition evolution, and explore table metadata. Finally, the lab will extend into Cloudera AI, where attendees will use interactive PySpark sessions to further demonstrate Iceberg's ACID compliance and data management capabilities.
